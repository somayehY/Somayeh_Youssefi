From the gentle whisper of owls' wings to the haunting echo of a lone wolf 's cry, each scene resonates with the beauty and sacredness of nature. But when bulldozers invade the forest, the tree senses its impending destruction and asks, Who will house the owl? And who will hold that river's shore? And who will take refuge in my shadow, if my shadow falls no more? A stunningly illustrated book, The Tree sounds an urgent call to preserve our fragile environment, reminding each of us that hope for a brighter future lies in our own hands. ?I love this book!?

Gentle watercolor pictures show a landscape changing through the various times of day and the turning seasons, months and years, and the activities of the people and animals who come to live there. But the seemingly simple plan of the book is deceptive: look more carefully and you will see one-to-one correspondences; groups and sets; scales and tabulations; changes over time periods; and many other mathematical relationships as they occur in natural, everyday living. Just as our forebears developed our number system from observing the order of nature, the reader is subtly led to see and understand the real meaning of numbers.\\nLook at this book and look again. Each time you do so, you will find another application of a natural mathematical concept that you had not noticed before.\",\n",

Through the lenses of powerful microscopes, he has examined objects most people have never even thought about: a mosquito's foot, a crystal of sugar, a grain of pollen, the delicate hairs on a blade of grass. Hidden Worlds takes you behind the scenes of Dennis's work and explains how he captures his remarkable images of microscopic life and objects. You'll learn how Dennis became interested in microscopes as a boy, how he prepares specimens for study, and how different kinds of microscopes work. You'll also have the chance to follow Dennis as he collects in the field--from the ash-covered slopes of Mount St. Helens to the lava tubes, rainforests, and beaches of his home state of Hawaii.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"When a novel like Huckleberry Finn, or The Yearling, comes along it defies customary adjectives because of the intensity of the respouse it evokes in the reader. Such a book, we submit, is Old Yeller; to read this eloquently simple story of a boy and his dog in the Texas hill country is an unforgettable and deeply moving experience.\\nThe big, ugly, yellow dog showed up out of nowhere one night and stole a whole side of hanging pork, and when Travis went for him the next morning that dog started yelling like a baby before he was touched. Then he got into the spring water with five-year-old Arliss, Travis took an easy hate to Old Yeller, as they started to call him; in fact, he would have driven him off or killed him if it hadn't been for brother Arliss' loud and violent protests, So Yeller stayed, and Travis soon found he couldn't have got along without him.\\nPa and Ma and Travis and Arliss lived on Birdsong Creek in the Texas hill country. It wasn't an easy life, but they had a snug cabin that Pa had built himself, and they had their own hogs and their own cattle, and they grew most of what else they needed. The only thing they and the rest of the settlers lacked that year in the late 1860's was cash, so the men decided to get together and drive all the cattle up to the new market in Abilene, Kansas, more than six hundred miles away.\\nTravis was only fourteen, but he was proud of his new role as man of the family and determined to live up to his responsibility. It was hard work, too, plowing until his legs ached, chopping wood until his hands were raw and his head was spinning, weeding the garden in the hot sun, toting the heavy buckets tip from the spring, and trying to keep his mischievous little brother in line.\\nBut there were pleasant moments, too: his Ma treating him like a man, and deer hunting in the early-morning stillness, and hot summer nights out in the corn patch under the stars with Old Yeller, trying to keep the coons and skunks out of the winter food supply. And there was plenty of excitement, like the fight between the two bulls, and the time Arliss nearly got mauled by the bear, and trying to catch and mark the new hogs. Here the suspense and excitement reach a peak, only to be topped a few pages later when the crazy-sick loafer wolf goes for Ma. Both times it is Yeller who saves them, only the second time it is not lucky for Yeller, as Travis comes to find out. And in finding out, Travis learns just how much he has come to love that big ugly dog, and he learns something about the pain of life, too.\\nOld Yeller is a story that will be read and treasured by many thousands for years to come. In a shorter form, this has appeared as a three-part serial in Collier's.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"First published in 1865, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland began as a story told to Alice Liddell and her two sisters on a boating trip in July of 1862. The novel follows Alice down a rabbit-hole and into a surreal world of strange and wonderful characters who constantly turn everything upside-down with their mind-boggling logic and word play, and their fantastic parodies. Carroll's fable illustrates his masterful ability to weave logic with nonsense in a tale that continues to delight all ages.While this great classic is widely available, the Broadview edition is unique. Richard Kelly combines Alice's Adventures in Wonderland not with the later (and largely distinct) work Through the Looking Glass but rather with Alice's Adventures Under Ground, Lewis Carroll's first version of the story. Readers are thus able to trace the literary revisions, and to compare Caroll's own illustrations in the original with the famous John Tenniel illustrations for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Among the many other materials included in the Broadview Literary Texts edition are a substantial selection of early reviews, selections from Carroll's diaries and correspondence, Carroll's early nonsense poems, and the originals of the poems parodied in his text.\",\n",

The adventures of Alice--named for one of the little girls to whom the book was dedicated--who journeys down a rabbit hole and into a whimsical underworld realm instantly struck a chord with the British public, and then with readers around the world. In 1872, in reaction to the universal acclaim *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* received, Dodgson published this sequel. Nothing is quite what it seems once Alice journeys through the looking-glass, and Dodgson's wit is infectious as he explores concepts of mirror imagery, time running backward, and strategies of chess-all wrapped up in the exploits of a spirited young girl who parries with the Red Queen, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and other unlikely characters. In many ways, this sequel has had an even greater impact on today's pop culture than the first book.\",\n",

Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be \"curiouser and curiouser,\" seemingly without moral or sense.\\nFor more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully non-moralistic, non-educational virtues of this classic.

       "  'description': \"PreSchool-Grade 2-The star of Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! (Hyperion, 2003) returns in another irresistible tale. Hurrying away to brush his teeth, the pajama-clad bus driver implores readers not to let his feathered friend stay up late. Youngsters are thrust into the role of caregiver as the puerile pigeon attempts to talk his way out of the inevitable, coming up with requests that range from manipulative (I hear there's a good show about birds on TV tonight. Should be very educational) to cajoling (Y'know, we never get to talk anymore. Tell me about your day-|) to classic (Can I have a glass of water?). Meanwhile, the fowl fights yawns and tries to keep his wide eye open, despite a drooping lid. Defying drowsiness to the last, he finally falls asleep, clutching his stuffed bunny tightly under his wing. Set against comfortably faded pastel backgrounds, the cartoon artwork focuses tightly on the main character, with his comments presented in dialogue balloons. The black-crayon lines speak volumes, as the pigeon's body language and the positioning of his ever-expressive eye humorously convey each nuance of the text. Children will be charmed by this bedtime treat, which will have them laughing out loud at the pigeon-and at themselves.-Joy Fleishhacker, School Library Journal\\nCopyright (c) Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Feeling different made her feel sad. Penny\\'s mom assured her that her hair is perfect. Just because her hair is different from her friends hair, it didn\\'t mean that it was bad. Penny\\'s mom decides to style her hair in puffballs, magic puffballs. Penny learns though a series of fun adventures, that wonderful and magical things happen when she wears her puffballs. Join Penny as she discovers the magic of her puffballs. Message from the author: Penny was born out of my love for my daughter, Paris, and my desire for her to feel comfortable, confident and secure in her skin. Paris questioned why her hair was different from all of the other girls\\' and wondered why she couldn\\'t wear her hair like theirs. I wanted her to understand that her hair was different but that different didn\\'t mean bad. One night, I made up a bedtime story about a little girl named Penny who had magic puffballs in her hair. Both my daughter and my son loved it so much that they wanted to hear about Penny every night. To keep it interesting, each night I added a different adventure, and from time to time I introduced additional characters. The kids loved these stories so much that Penny became a staple in our bedtime routine. I ended up with more than 30 stories, and we enjoyed Penny\\'s adventures for many, many years. The idea for a book came to me as I saw little girls throughout my travels with their hair styled in puffballs. I thought it would be great to be able to tell these girls the story of Penny, a little girl like them. Little girls often notice their hair as one of the first areas of difference, and seeing this as bad can lead to a poor self-image. It is my hope that through this book, other girls will see a bit of themselves in Penny and enjoy her magic puffballs.',\n",

A large lizard, ever conscious of tripping hazards, picks up the infant and takes her home, where she soon grows into a pretty, pampered, and generally useless young woman named Isabella. Despite her adoptive mother's efforts (for the lizard is really a witch in disguise) to shape her up, the girl prefers the alluring life offered her by the charming Prince Rupert, a world of cooks and servants, palaces and jewels, luxury and indolence. Luckily, the lizard woman is a canny, concerned parent. She does not suffer fools lightly and is not about to let her daughter's too-easy transition to palace life go unchallenged. And so she arranges a surprise transformation for her daughter one that puts the prince's marital plans on hold and gives the witch just enough time to hammer home a few lessons about the downside of idleness, the inanity of vanity, and the satisfactions of self-reliance. In this witty, modern interpretation of a classic Italian folktale, Leah Marinsky Sharpe has crafted a light-hearted mother-daughter fable with a moral that is sure to strike a chord with readers of all ages. The illustrations by Jane Marinsky glow with rich color and playful humor. Together, words and pictures provide a zesty treat for parents and children alike.\",\n",

Struggling with self-doubt, Tani is helped through the challenging terrain of her homeland by the wise animals of the forest, such as Bear, Otter and Salamander, the guiding spirit of her departed grandmother, and the magical Stick Indian, whose presence on the shadowy fringes once inspired fear in Tani.

If successful, Leon will fulfil his destined role as the Chosen One and Savina's armies will be defeated. If they fail, the world will be plunged into chaos. Can seven children prevail against the might of sorcery and dark magic? Perhaps they can if they harness the power of the seven given souls and control their morphing powers. But before this can be attempted they have a lot of growing up to do, and much to learn about themselves and one another.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Clement C. Moore\\'s beloved poem about Santa\\'s arrival on Christmas Eve has been illustrated by hundreds of artists since its first publication in 1823. Two collectors of antique children\\'s books have selected a variety of these charming pictures from Arthur Rackham, Jessie Willcox Smith, Thomas Nast, and other renowned children\\'s illustrators of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Most of the images are from versions of the poem; a few are from antique postcards or magazines. Source notes for all the illustrations are included. Santa is dressed differently by each artist, but he is always \"chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf\" who brings joy to all good little girls and boys. This attractive edition of The Night Before Christmaswill be enjoyed most by collectors of children\\'s books or lovers of things Victorian. Youngsters who are already familiar with the poem will delight in comparing the different old-fashioned Santas and the children of long ago \"nestled all snug in their beds.\" A charming holiday gift to leave under the tree on Christmas Eve for anyone who believes in the magic of Santa Claus.

But as the boy grew older he began to want more from the tree, and the tree gave and gave and gave.\\nThis is a tender story, touched with sadness, aglow with consolation. Shel Silverstein has created a moving parable for readers of all ages that offers an affecting interpretation of the gift of giving and a serene acceptance of another's capacity to love in return.\\nShel Silverstein's very first children's book Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back was published in 1963, and followed the next year by two other books. The first of those, The Giving Tree,is a moving story about the love of a tree for a boy; it took four years before Harper Children's books decided to publish it. Shel returned to humour that same year withA Giraffe and a Half.His first collection of poems and drawings, Where the Sidewalk Ends,appeared in 1974, and his second, A Light in the Attic,in 1981.When he was a G.I. in Japan and Korea in the 1950, he learned to play the guitar and to write songs, including 'A Boy Named Sue' for Johnny Cash. In 1984, Silverstein won a Grammy Award for Best Children's Album for Where the Sidewalk Ends- 'recited, sung and shouted' by the author. He was also an accomplished playwright, including the 1981 hit, 'The Lady or the Tiger Show.' The last book to be published before he died in 1999, was Falling Up(1996).\",\n",

Young Sam Gribley gets to the end of the block and keeps going--all the way to the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. There he sets up house in a huge hollowed-out tree, with a falcon and a weasel for companions and his wits as his tool for survival. In a spellbinding, touching, funny account, Sam learns to live off the land, and grows up a little in the process. Blizzards, hunters, loneliness, and fear all battle to drive Sam back to city life.

No reader will be immune to the compulsion to go right out and start whittling fishhooks and befriending raccoons.\\nJean Craighead George, author of more than 80 children's books, including the Newbery Medal-winning Julie of the Wolves, created another prizewinner with My Side of the Mountain--a Newbery Honor Book, an ALA Notable Book, and a Hans Christian Andersen Award Honor Book. Astonishingly, she wrote its sequel, On the Far Side of the Mountain, 30 years later, and a decade after that penned the final book in the trilogy, Frightful's Mountain, told from the falcon's point of view.

       "  'description': \"Now available in a deluxe, affordable paperback and compact disc package comes the hip, hilarious retelling of Hans Christian Andersen's beloved fairy tale reimagined by an all-star cast. Each celebrity has created a character with a uniquely recognizable celebrity personality. And each character is lavishly illustrated by an acclaimed artist. The accompanying compact disc brings the story to life with music, sound effects, and all the humor and dramatic flair of the celebrity authors' finest performances-in a one-of-a-kind audio event for the entire family. And all this talent is for a unique charity-the Starbright Foundation. Royalties are donated to support this foundation dedicated to improving the lives of seriously ill children. The Starbright Foundation is working to change the face of childhood illness. By recognizing the link between a child's state of mind and the ability to recover from illness, Starbright creates products and programs that enable seriously ill children to confront the challenges they face every day. Starbright projects do more than educate or simply entertain, they address the core issues that accompany serious illness-the pain, fear, loneliness, and depression that can be as damaging as the sickness itself. The Starbright Foundation is best known for Starbright World, a private computer network connecting children from hospitals across the nation. Through this and other innovative combinations of technology, medicine, and entertainment, Starbright ensures that no child need sacrifice quality of life to an illness. For more information about the Starbright Foundation, please call (800) 315-2580 or visit the Starbright Web site at http://www.starbright.org.\",\n",

She's danced for almost as long as she can remember and started ballet lessons when she was four. Now Ellie is presented with the opportunity of a lifetime-a chance to audition for a spot to dance with the Royal Ballet. But Ellie knows that even if she won a place, it would mean moving to London and leaving her ill-stricken mother behind with no one to care for her.

       "  'description': '\"Are trees alive? How do they breathe? They don\\'t have noses.\"\\nAnd so begins a conversation between the author and her daughter that leads to a remarkable discovery: Trees are like children in so many ways! They may look very different from people, but trees have roots that hold them to the ground like feet and leaves that blow in the wind like hair. Their bark even comes in different colors, just like our skin.\\nFrom this poetic comparison of plants and humans, readers will learn how trees live and grow, and how they get their food. They will learn about the baobab trees of Africa, the banyan trees of India, and the bristlecone pines of California. They will see, through Stacey Schuett\\'s exquisite art, that trees come in all shapes and sizes-just like people-and provide a home to many different animals. But most of all, they will look at trees with greater respect and a bit of awe, after realizing that trees are alive too.',\n",

JUDGES' COMMENtS 'this heart warming story of a young orphan boy who finally finds a home is depicted with beautiful use of language. Millard offers young readers moving insights into the business of being family, and how 'belonging' can be a wide and generous experience. Neatly sidestepping overt sentimentality, much of the charm of this work lies in the gentleness and goodness inherent in the people who inhabit the book' - WA Premier's Literary Award judges, 2008 'together the individual characters in this story nurture and encourage each other, revealing a heart-warming picture of how delightfully rewarding fostering can be for all concerned. this third book in the Kingdom of Silk series is as engaging as the first two titles. Like the previous stories, it is wonderfully written and can be read as a stand-alone book which is not always the case for books in a series. Millard has a wonderful way of developing her characters, drawing the reader into the context of the story' - NSW Premier's Literary Award judges, 2009\",\n",

What follows is his delightful short story overflowing with wonderful wordplay called A Child\\'s Christmas in Wales:\\n\"One Christmas was so much like another, in those years around the sea-town corner now & out of all sound except the distant speaking of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days & six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days & twelve nights when I was six.\\nAll the Christmases roll down toward the two-tongued sea, like a cold & headlong moon bundling down the sky that was our street; and they stop at the rim of the ice-edged fish-freezing waves, & I plunge my hands in the snow & bring out whatever I can find. In goes my hand into that wool-white bell-tongued ball of holidays resting at the rim of the carol-singing sea, & out come Mrs. Prothero and the firemen.\\nIt was on the afternoon of the Christmas Eve, & I was in Mrs. Prothero\\'s garden, waiting for cats, with her son Jim. It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas. December, in my memory, is white as Lapland, though there were no reindeers. But there were cats. Patient, cold & callous, our hands wrapped in socks, we waited to snowball the cats. Sleek & long as jaguars & horrible-whiskered, spitting & snarling, they would slink & sidle over the white back-garden walls, & the lynx-eyed hunters, Jim & I, fur-capped & moccasined trappers from Hudson Bay, off Mumbles Road, would hurl our deadly snowballs at the green of their eyes. The wise cats never appeared...\"',\n",

       "  'description': 'Originally written in 1845 by German physician Heinrich Hoffmann (1809-1894), \\'Der Struwwelpeter\\' reads like a fairy tale breaking loose from a doomed rollercoaster, crashing through a rusty calliope, and finally splashing into the miasmic ooze of Hell--but somehow still managing to float. Mesmerized as a child by the nightmarish prose and haunting images contained in the book, noted author/illustrator Bob Staake (MADmagazine, Cartoon Network, even Hallmark Cards) gives a 21st century spin to these 14 stories-each more politically incorrect than the next. The nastiest things happen to children who disobey the wishes of their parents: thumb suckers have their digits cut off, the pyro-fascinated are set ablaze and, of course, picky eaters rot away and die prematurely. In other words, precisely the type of bedtime stories you\\'ll want to read to a six-year-old, provided it\\'s not yoursix-year-old.\\nGorgeously designed and illustrated, Staake\\'s Struwwelpeteris sure to spark as many \"oooo\\'s\" and \"ahhhh\\'s\" as it does nightmares.\\nThis is a new Blab!storybook, a series of graphic novels showcasing artists from Monte Beauchamp\\'s annual BLAB!anthology, presented in a faux-children\\'s book format, though aimed squarely at adults and young adults.',\n",

She relates to the dilapidated house she has moved to, as she sits sad and forlorn upon its broken front step. But, as the story unfolds, the house is gradually repaired paralleling how the child's perception of her new situation improves. Each time the child passes 'through the gate', into the world beyond, she notices more of her surroundings and discovers that her new life has some wonderful things in it. The messages delivered through this story can be understood at different levels - literal and metaphorical. Nothing stays the same and difficult times will pass. A little effort in maintenance can improve our physical surroundings, yet our perceptions also colour our world. These messages are relevant to both children and adults, as we all experience many changes throughout our lives and draw on our resilience as we adapt to them.

Younger children can be involved in spotting the more obvious changes and older children will be challenged with the more subtle transformations.\",\n",

Young Sam Gribley gets to the end of the block and keeps going--all the way to the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. There he sets up house in a huge hollowed-out tree, with a falcon and a weasel for companions and his wits as his tool for survival. In a spellbinding, touching, funny account, Sam learns to live off the land, and grows up a little in the process. Blizzards, hunters, loneliness, and fear all battle to drive Sam back to city life. But his desire for freedom, independence, and adventure is stronger. No reader will be immune to the compulsion to go right out and start whittling fishhooks and befriending raccoons. Jean Craighead George, author of more than 80 children's books, including the Newbery Medal-winning Julie of the Wolves, created another prizewinner with My Side of the Mountain--a Newbery Honor Book, an ALA Notable Book, and a Hans Christian Andersen Award Honor Book. Astonishingly, she wrote its sequel, On the Far Side of the Mountain, 30 years later, and a decade after that penned the final book in the trilogy, Frightful's Mountain, told from the falcon's point of view. George has no doubt shaped generations of young readers with her outdoor adventures of the mind and spirit. (Ages 9 to 12) --Emilie Coulter\",\n",

In the accompanying spread, the knock-kneed younger sheep smiles adoringly at its mother, as clouds of geometric glass shapes in creams, greens, blues, and browns create their woolly coats. While there are occasional hiccups in the lilt of Keith\\'s verse, the artistry she brings to her animal portraits--brightly colored squares on the breasts of her owl family resemble patchwork sweaters, while enamel painting gives her pigs speckled skin and faces that exude contentment--mark her as a real talent.

While many of the principles in The Adventures of Blue Ocean Bob may appear basic or widely accepted, they are often not taught to children as part of a regular school curriculum. We hope that the Blue Ocean Bob books and products are fun, colorful and inspiring while they also provide children with a framework for success in any endeavor they choose to pursue. In addition, we hope the Blue Ocean Bob characters and stories will develop an appreciation and respect for our oceans and sea life in children from an early age.\",\n",

According to her, he needs to do some serious thinking about what it means to be a Siamese cat instead of a bird (Skippyjon always wakes up and eats worms with his feathered friends). She sends him to his room, where he imagines he is a Chihuahua (\"My name is Skippito Friskito./I fear not a single bandito\"). Chock-full of rhyming chants and Spanish expressions, the feline\\'s adventure as a doggy Zorro ends in chaos. His frazzled mother gives him a hug anyway and says, \"Say good night, Skippyjon Jones.\" \"Buenas noches, mis amigos,\" says the kitten, as he bounces on his bed all ready for another adventure. The buoyant and colorful cartoon illustrations match the exuberant text perfectly. Spanish-speaking children will be especially delighted by the words and humor; others may be a little bewildered by all of the foreign phrases and will need some explanation, but the story definitely has the potential of a fun read-aloud.
